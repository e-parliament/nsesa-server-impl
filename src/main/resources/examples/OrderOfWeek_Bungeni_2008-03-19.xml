                                appreciating the critical role Bungeni Farmers Association (KFA) once
                                played in the Agricultural Sector as reliable supply chain for farm inputs and a
                                marketing conduit for produce; Noting with deep concern that the collapse of the
                                65,000 Member KFA has adversely affected the welfare of the Bungenian farmer and
                                stability of the agricultural sector; Aware that the said collapse of KFA was a
                                consequence of mismanagement and abandonment by Government; Acknowledging
                                that the gallant efforts by farmers to revive KFA have been hampered by a heavy
                                burden of bad debts accumulated by reason of the said mismanagement and
                                Government inertia; Concerned that various creditors, including National Bank of
                                Bungeni, Barclays Bank and Workers, are moving to auction properties of KFA, further
                                encumbering the noble revival efforts; Convinced that the immediate resuscitation of
                                KFA is a matter of strategic national importance; this House urges the Government to
                                immediately avail a grant of Kshs. 1.3 Billion to KFA to help clear the bad debts and
                                enable it restructure and contribute to the rapid growth of the Agricultural sector in
                                line with Vision 2030.

                                deeply concerned with the devastation of the prolonged drought on
                                farming activities that has occasioned heavy losses to farmers; aware that many affected
                                farmers have loans from the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC) amounting to a total
                                of Kshs. 4.48 billion; concerned that the prolonged drought has adversely affected
                                farmers’ capacity to service their said loans with the effect that a loan portfolio of
                                Kshs
                                1.81 billion has now been classified by AFC as bad loans due to widespread defaults;
                                convinced that unless this loan portfolio in default is addressed urgently, AFC and the
                                agricultural sector face the risk of irreparable damage; acknowledging the key role
                                played
                                by AFC in financing the agricultural sector and the importance of supporting farmers
                                countrywide as the anchor for vision 2030; this House urges the Government to urgently
                                avail a grant of Kshs. 2 billion to the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC) to enable
                                it
