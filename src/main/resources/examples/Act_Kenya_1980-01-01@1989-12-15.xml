            <p>WHEREAS is desirable that the present powers relating to the management and
                conservation of wildlife in Kenya should be amalgamated and placed in a consolidated
                Service of the Government;
            </p>
            <p>AND WHEREAS the prime objective of the Service should be to ensure that wildlife is

                areas in particular, optimum returns in terms of cultural, aesthetic and scientific
                gains as well as such economic gains as are incidental to proper wildlife management
                and conservation and which may be secured without prejudice to such proper
                management and conservation;
            </p>
            <p>AND WHEREAS it is necessary, for the achievement of that objective, that full
                account should be taken of the varied forms of land use and the inter-relationship
                between wildlife conservation and management and other forms of land use:
