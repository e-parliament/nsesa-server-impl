                                . According to the Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice
                                Statistics, there were approximately 14 000 criminal offences per 100 000 population
                                in the EU Member States in 2007 (excluding Italy and Portugal for which data were
                                not made available), ranging from 14 465 offences in Sweden to 958 in Cyprus.
                                Europol’s EU Organised Crime Threat Assessment 2009 (OCTA 2009), points out that
                                most organised crime involves international travel, typically aimed at smuggling
                                persons, drugs or other illicit goods into the EU.

                            <p>At the same time, terrorists and terrorist organisations can be found both inside
                                and outside the borders of the EU. The terrorist attacks in the United States in
                                2001, the aborted terrorist attack in August 2006 aimed at blowing up a number of
                                aircraft on their way from the United Kingdom to the United States, and the
                                attempted terrorist attack on board a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit in December
                                2009 showed the ability of terrorists to mount attacks, targeting international
                                flights, in any country. While terrorism decreased in the EU during 2009, according
                                to Europol’s EU Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 2010, the threat of terrorism
                                remains real and serious. Most terrorist activities are transnational in character
                                and involve international travel

                                Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction points to the global nature of the
                                drugs problem and the growing and severe harm it entails. By undermining social
                                development and feeding corruption and organised crime it represents a real threat
                                for the European Union. Approximately 1 000 lives are lost in the EU annually due to
                                cocaine-related deaths. The number of opioid users in Europe is cautiously estimated
                                at 1.35 million. As regards the economic and social impacts of drugs, in 2008, 22 EU
                                Member States reported a total expenditure relating to illicit drugs of EUR 4.2
                                billion.

                            <p>PNR data enable law enforcement authorities to identify persons who were previously
                                "unknown", i.e. persons previously unsuspected of involvement in serious crime and
                                terrorism, but whom an analysis of the data suggests may be involved in such crime
                                and who should therefore be subject to further examination by the competent
                                authorities. By using PNR data law enforcement authorities can address the threat of
                                serious crime and terrorism from a different perspective than through the processing
                                of other categories of personal data. However, in order to ensure that the
                                processing of data of innocent and unsuspected persons remains as limited as
                                possible, the aspects of the use of PNR data relating to the creation and
                                application of assessment criteria should be further limited to serious crimes that
                                are also transnational in nature, i.e. are intrinsically linked to travelling and
                                hence the type of the data being processed.

                                2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest Warrant and the surrender

                                can reach into (access) the air carrier’s reservation system and extract (‘pull’) a
                                copy of the required data, and the ‘push’ method, under which air carriers transfer
                                (‘push’) the required PNR data to the authority requesting them, thus allowing air
                                carriers to retain control of what data is provided. The ‘push’ method is considered
                                to offer a higher degree of data protection and should be mandatory for all air
                                carriers.

                            <p>The Commission supports the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)
                                guidelines on PNR. These guidelines should thus be the basis for adopting the
                                supported data formats for transfers of PNR data by air carriers to Member States.
                                This justifies that such supported data formats, as well as the relevant protocols
                                applicable to the transfer of data from air carriers should be adopted in accordance

                                necessary that the PNR data are retained for a sufficiently long period for carrying
                                out analysis and for use in investigations. In order to avoid disproportionate use,

                                accordingly. The Directive is compatible with data protection principles and its
                                provisions are in line with the Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Furthermore, and in
                                order to comply with the proportionality principle, the Directive, on specific
                                issues, will have stricter rules on data protection than the Framework Decision

                                must be deleted, the data must be anonymised after a very short period, the
                                collection and use of sensitive data is prohibited. In order to ensure efficiency
                                and a high level of data protection, Member States are required to ensure that an
                                independent national supervisory authority is responsible for advising and
                                monitoring how PNR data are processed. All processing of PNR data must be logged or
                                documented for the purpose of verification of the lawfulness of the data processing,
                                self-monitoring and ensuring proper data integrity and security of the data

                                        with Article 9(1), and, if necessary, also the result of the processing of PNR
                                        data. The request for such data may be based on any one or a combination of data

                                        terrorist offences or serious crime. Passenger Information Units shall provide
                                        the requested data as soon as practicable and shall provide also the result of
                                        the processing of PNR data, if it has already been prepared pursuant to Article
