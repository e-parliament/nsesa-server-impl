                                The Constitution provides that Bills may be introduced in Parliament by a member of the
                                Executive [only in the NA] or any member or committee of the House concerned

                                In practice, with a few exceptions, all Bills coming before Parliament emanate from the
                                Executive. Ordinary Bills [ie excluding Constitution amendment Bills and money Bills]
                                normally go through the following stages:

                                        The first stage involves initiating, developing and formal executive approval
                                        of the draft legislation. Usually a first draft is prepared by departmental
                                        specialists, sometimes assisted by consultants, after consultation with
                                        interested persons and institutions.
                                        The draft is then submitted to Cabinet for approval in principle.

                                        Joint Rule 159 requires that once Cabinet has approved the legislative
                                        proposals,
                                        the draft of the proposed Bill must be sent to Parliament,
                                        together with a memorandum explaining the objects of the proposed legislation.
                                        The Speaker and the NCOP Chairperson must refer the draft to the responsible
                                        committees of the respective Houses.
                                        The purpose of this procedure is to assist the committees in planning their
                                        work and to enable committee members to acquaint themselves with and to develop
                                        their positions with regard to the proposed legislation.

                                                purpose is lost. Parliament often does not receive the Rule 159 draft
                                                before the final Bill is submitted to Parliament for introduction.

                                                The purpose of Joint rule 159 is to make Parliament aware that proposed
                                                legislation is coming; hence it is not necessary for the whole draft
                                                Bill to be sent to Parliament at that stage – the long title or a

                                    There needs to be substantial engagement between Parliament and the Executive on
                                    all pre-introduction processes for Bills, and specifically the application of Joint
                                    rule
                                    159, NA rule 241 and NCOP rule 186.

                                    Since the purpose of Joint rule 159 is to alert Parliament about an imminent
                                    Bill [see paragraph 1(2) above], it is recommended that the rule should
                                    require only the long title of the draft Bill or a summary of its objectives
                                    to be sent to Parliament.

                                    Since the purpose of the notices in terms of NA rule 241 and NCOP rule 186
                                    is to inform the public of the imminent introduction of a Bill in Parliament
                                    [see paragraph 1(5) above], consideration should be given to publishing only
                                    the long title or a summary of the objectives of the Bill concerned.
                                    Publication of the Bill itself in the Government Gazette could follow at a
                                    later stage. [See also the recommendation in paragraph 6 (b) below

                                In terms of Joint Rule 220(1), a Bill introduced in either House has to be in
                                one of the official languages. The Bill in that language will be the official
                                text for purposes of parliamentary proceedings. In parliamentary proceedings
                                only the official text of a Bill is considered [Joint Rule 220(4)].
                                A translation of the Bill into at least one of the other official languages has
                                to be in Parliament’s possession at least three days before the formal
                                consideration of the Bill by the House in which it was introduced
                                [Joint Rule 220(2)]. Such a translated version of a Bill is referred to as the
                                “official translation”. The cover page of a Bill specifies which
                                language version of the Bill is the official text and which is an official
                                translation [Joint Rule 220(3)]. Since the adoption of Joint Rule 220 in 1999,
                                the official text of all Bills has been in English.
                                The language of the official translations of Bills has varied according to the
                                preferences of the introducers of the Bills.

                                Some countries have a legislation handbook which sets out the legislative process
                                in fine detail. It stipulates the roles of the various stakeholders as well as
                                the procedures to be followed in the different stages of making and amending laws.
                                The handbook has an official status and serves as a general guide in relation to
                                the legislative process

                                The handbook should set out the principles, processes and practices involved
                                in making Acts of Parliament, from inception to completion.
                                It should be a guide for everyone involved to better understand the
                                parliamentary legislative process.
