                            The Department’s 2007/08 -2009/10 Strategic Plan is aligned with key government priorities
                            which includes: the consolidation of the African Agenda; halving unemployment and poverty by
                            2014;
                            national human resource development as well as fighting crime and corruption.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through specific cluster and programme interventions the Department would address
                            the following key departmental strategic objectives: the creation of national and
                            continental stability through increasing peace mission deployments;
                            skills development through the Military Skills Development System [MSDS]
                            and training to military personnel exiting the military; assistance to the South
                            African police services in emergency cases and the development of scarce skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The annual budget for the current MTEF period reflects a growth from R20.5 billion
                            in 2003/2004; to R25.9 billion in 2007/2008 and to R28.9 billion for 2009/2010
                            financial years.

                        <p>
                            An additional R1.2 billion has been allocated to the department for the current financial
                            year. The reasons for such additional funding were cited as follows:

                                The Strategic Business Plan identified the need for IT-based internal control
                                systems for finance, human resources and procurement, as well as a time frame
                                for the implementation of the integrated finance management system. 
                                To date, IT systems have been slightly enhanced in line with the moratorium
                                placed by the National Treasury on the replacement of the current system.
                                The alignment would be addressed through projects such as Loquacious,
                                Lekgadima and Balance Scorecard.

                                A doubling of annual increases for this programme over the current MTEF
                                cycle was reported, due to the devolution of funding from the Department
                                of Public Works.

                                R1.93billion had been allocated for the 2007/2008 financial year and
                                represented a 9.9 percent budgetary increase.

                                direction have increased by 12.3 and 27.8 percent respectively.
                                This was mainly due to the relocation of the
                                National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC) inspectorate.
                                An increased international representation accounted for the increased
                                allocation to Defence Foreign Relations (DFR)

                                financial years, R4,21billion had been allocated for the current financial year.
                                The total annual budget for the general training has increased by 41.6 percent to expand
                                conventional reserves training and the intake into the Military Skills Development
                                Strategy (MSDS).
                                Since new generation art equipment had been commissioned,
                                Artillery and Air Defence reflected a 12.6 and 11.4 percent increase in allocations
                                respectively.

                                the rejuvenation of the MSDS, and the efficiency of the Military Exit Mechanism [MEM],
                                as discussed in the Strategic Business Plan. Additional risks were also identified which
                                included: the continued deterioration of facilities; the impact of insufficient funding
                                and

                                programmes over the next three years was reported. This was mainly due to
                                the imperatives of the strategic airlift capability, which will grow by 25.1
                                percent.

                            as the consolidation of a research and development focus.

                            Evaluation and Research Institute [DERI] and the transfer of the naval
                            dockyard to Armscor.

                            Following the outcomes of the Portfolio Committee on Defence’s interactions
                            with the Department as well as careful consideration of information provided,
                            the Committee submits the following recommendations for consideration by
                            the Minister of Defence:

                                    The implementation of plans for the modernisation and renewal of the
                                    landward defence is critical and this needs to commence as soon as possible;

                                    The planned reduction in flying hours threatens the achievement of a
                                    100 percent capability, and the quality of training of fighter pilots
                                    at the new air force base. And this needs to be corrected;

                                    The Committee noted with concern South Africa’s increasing contribution
                                    and participation in peacekeeping operations. However, the Committee recommends
                                    that efforts be made to ensure that the African Union takes responsibility
                                    for the bulk of peacekeeping missions on the continent while more funding be
                                    allocated to the Department for its involvement.
