                            <p>asked the Minister for Education and
                                Sports the organic relations between the Bungeni National Association

                                (IAGRAT) in pursuance of the professional and trade union rights of
                                teachers in the country and trade union rights of teachers in the
                                country, because the two are not the same. And in his Answer, he
                                referred to professional rights of both members. Does it mean that
                                the IAGRAT has no trade union rights as his Answer states? Because,
                                the two are not the same. Professional rights are different from

                            <p>Mr. Speaker, BNAT was the only umbrella professional body for
                                teachers in the country until when some graduate teachers started
                                agitation for recognition and finally broke away and formed the
                                National Association of Graduate Teachers (NAGRAT).
                            </p>
                            <p>Currently, there are two (2) associations serving the interest of
                                teachers in the BES<noteRef href="#not01" marker="1"/>.
                                Whereas members of IAGRAT consist of a section
                                of graduate teachers, BNATcovers nongraduates as well as graduate teachers.
                            </p>
                            <p>The professional rights of both members of BNAT and IAGRAT are
                                assured as outlined in the Conditions and Scheme of Service for
                                teachers. In the event, where a member of the Service has a problem,
                                he approaches the association to which he belongs and that
                                association handles the problem with BES in the light of the
                                Conditions of Service.

                            <p>In the area of professional development, BNAT organizes in-service
